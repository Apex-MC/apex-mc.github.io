			<p>Discord Bot:</p>
			<p>We made this discord bot because some people, including us need help to get more players to join our discord servers. With our bot, we let players across the world get more users on their server by advertising as a team to get more players. We also have a set of commands like a!say, a!ddos and more fun commands that we are sure that lots of people would like! The server is currently not 24/7 but soon we will do it 24/7 once there is much more players that want the discord bot to be available at all times. Some stuff are automatic but we still need some developing help! We are working on it everyday and hope to make one of the best bots in the history of Discord.</p><p>Command List:<br> – a!help<br> – a!cat<br> – a!oof<br> – a!user<br> – p!partner<br> – p!finish<br> – p!accept<br> – (More commands will be added in the future)</p><p>Support Server:<br><a class="link" href="http://jamesblair.nz/join-our-discord/">http://jamesblair.nz/join-our-discord/</a></p><p>Invite Link:<br><a class="link" href="http://jamesblair.nz/r/bot/invite">http://jamesblair.nz/r/bot/invite</a></p><p>Wiki:<br><a class="link" href="https://github.com/Apex-MC/Discord-Bot/wiki">https://github.com/Apex-MC/Discord-Bot/wiki</a></p><p>GitHub:<br><a class="link" href="https://github.com/Apex-MC/Discord-Bot">https://github.com/Apex-MC/Discord-Bot</a></p></div>
